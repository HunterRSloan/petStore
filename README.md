## Three Elements Liked About Using Io for the Project
1. Simplicity of syntax and ease of understanding.
2. Message-passing model provides clean object-oriented design.
3. Lightweight and fast execution.

## Three Elements of Io You Did Not Like (As Much)
1. Limited ecosystem and libraries compared to more popular languages.
2. Less extensive documentation and community resources.
3. Hard to use/install

## Most Important Reference
I primarily referred to the Io Language documentation: [Io Language Official Documentation](https://iolanguage.org/scm/io/docs/IoGuide.html)
